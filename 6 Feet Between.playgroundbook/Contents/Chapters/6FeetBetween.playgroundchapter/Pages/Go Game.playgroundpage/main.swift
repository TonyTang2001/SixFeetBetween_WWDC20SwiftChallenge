 # 6 Feet Between - Go Game!

 After your previous training, I am sure you know what to do by now. You are doing great, and I am fully confident in you! 😃 

 - - -

 But before you start your challenge, here are a few **last tips** for you:
 * Protect Yourself, be sure to stay 6 feet away from others! Even during your blink!
 * Mind your setps, try **not** to go out of screen.
 * If you are unsure about where to blink to, drag and hold to freeze the time.
 * Restart the game any time using the Swift Playground **Run/Stop** Button.

 - Important:
    To improve the program's overall performance, make sure to toggle off **Results** in the **Performance Panel** ⏱ located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the Swift Playground Run/Stop Button. 

 - Remember to switch on the ringtone and turn volumn to 50% 🔊 for the sound effects!

 - It is recommended to run this project on a 2018 and later iPad Pro model. Older devices may need longer compile and run time.

 - Ready, Set, Go! The clock is ticking.
