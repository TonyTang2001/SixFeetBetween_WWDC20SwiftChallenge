    Hi there, be sure to practice some basic actions before you start your üéÆ!
    You know... Practice makes perfect!


 Here are a few **tips** for you:
 * Protect Yourself, be sure to stay 6 feet away from others! Even during your blink! Otherwise you may get infected and lose the game.
 * Mind your setps, try **not** to go out of screen. The system won't let you do so.
 * If you are unsure about where to blink to, drag and hold to freeze the time for some thinking.

 - Important:
    To improve the program's overall performance, make sure to toggle off **Results** in the **Performance Panel** ‚è± located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the Swift Playground Run/Stop Button. 

 - Remember to switch on the ringtone and turn volumn to 50% üîä for the sound effects!

 - It is recommended to run this project on a 2018 and later iPad Pro model. Older devices may need longer compile and run time.
